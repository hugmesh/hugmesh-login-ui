/**
 * Ambient declarations for the two BUNDLED-LOCALLY animation dependencies.
 *
 * Neither package ships TypeScript types (three.js dropped its bundled `.d.ts`
 * long ago and publishes them as a separate `@types/three`; Vanta never had any),
 * and neither is worth pulling a large types package in for: this repo touches
 * exactly one three.js value — the module namespace, which it passes STRAIGHT
 * through to Vanta as the `THREE` option and never calls into — and exactly one
 * Vanta value, the effect factory. Typing those two surfaces here keeps the
 * dependency footprint honest and still gives `vanta-effects.ts` a real contract
 * to compile against.
 *
 * The `vanta/dist/*.min` subpaths are the PREBUILT UMD bundles. They are imported
 * rather than Vanta's `src/` entry because the sources are unbuilt ESM with glslify
 * shader imports, and because each dist file is a self-contained ~12KB effect that
 * takes three.js by injection — which is exactly the shape a lazy chunk wants.
